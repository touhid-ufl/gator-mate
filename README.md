# 🐊 GatorMate — Welcome to the Revolution of Education
## For the first time in human history, an AI can truly **teach like a human — and adapt like no human ever could**.

# 🎥 Just have a glimpse at a class generated by GatorMate  
GatorMate generated a full-length class of a graduate-level course at UF- "Introduction to Hardware Security". The teaching style and content is set accroding to a particular student's knowledge map, style preference, and course requirements.

# **Notice:** Given GatorMate’s first-of-its kind nature, the codebase is **not publicly released**.
> For verification of the codebase please contact the developers. We are happy to show you the codebase and the running system in person or through a Zoom call: mdtouhidul.islam@ufl.edu, arnabdebnath@ufl.edu, khanthamidhasan@ufl.edu, ymahmud@ufl.edu, md.hasan@ufl.edu

## **GatorMate** is redefining what it means to teach and learn.  

GatorMate is the world’s first **complete AI teacher**, capable of generating **naturally engaging, fluent video classes** tailored to each student’s **knowledge gaps**, **learning preferences**, and **course requirements they need to learn**.

Students can even interact with the AI teacher — asking questions mid-class and receiving intelligent, contextual answers — just like in a real classroom.

### ♿ Accessibility for the Visually Impaired  
Student can specify if they need any accessibility aid. Our intelligent AI system automatically describes out loud visual slide content, ensuring accessibility for blind and visually impaired learners. Note that it even **slows down narration speed** and adds more pauses considering impairment.
