# 🐊 GatorMate — Welcome to the Revolution of Education
## For the first time in human history, an AI can truly **teach like a human — and adapt like no human ever could**.

# 🎥 Just have a glimpse at a class generated by GatorMate  
GatorMate generated a full-length class of a graduate-level course at UF- "Introduction to Hardware Security". The teaching style and content is set accroding to a particular student's knowledge map, style preference, and course requirements.

## **GatorMate** is redefining what it means to teach and learn.  

GatorMate is the world’s first **complete AI teacher**, capable of generating **naturally engaging, fluent video classes** tailored to each student’s **knowledge gaps**, **learning preferences**, and **course requirements they need to learn**.

Students can even interact with the AI teacher — asking questions mid-class and receiving intelligent, contextual answers — just like in a real classroom.

### ♿ Accessibility for the Visually Impaired  
Student can specify if they need any accessibility aid. Our intelligent AI system automatically describes out loud visual slide content, ensuring accessibility for blind and visually impaired learners. Note that it even **slows down narration speed** and adds more pauses considering impairment.

## ⚙️ Full Features List

- **Dynamic Knowledge Mapping**  
  Builds a comprehensive *knowledge map* for each student — identifying what they already know, what they don’t, and how each concept connects to their existing understanding.

- **Human-Like Lecture Generation**  
  Produces lectures in a **natural, emotionally expressive tone**, with a fluent and engaging delivery indistinguishable from a human instructor.

- **Individually Tailored Content**  
  Every lecture is uniquely generated based on the student’s learning needs — offering **more examples, analogies, or simplified explanations** where appropriate.

- **Adaptive Visual Learning Support**  
  For students who benefit from visual learning, GatorMate intelligently integrates **relevant YouTube videos** at the right points in the lecture — automatically selecting and trimming only the most relevant portions to maintain the natural flow of instruction.

- **Interactive & Context-Aware Feedback**  
  Enables real-time interactivity. Students can **pause the lecture**, ask questions, and receive **contextual, content-aware answers** — just like in a live classroom.

- **Personalized Lecture Video Generation**  
  Generates a complete, personalized lecture video using:
  - The student’s **knowledge map** (what they know and don’t know)  
  - **Course slides or PDFs**  
  - **Course outline** *(optional)*  
  - **Instructor’s lecture or transcript** *(optional)*  

- **Accessibility-Aware Class Generation**  
  Creates dedicated versions for students with impairments.  
  For example, for **visually impaired students**, the AI:
  - Provides detailed **verbal descriptions of diagrams and visuals**  
  - Automatically **reduces narration speed** to enhance comprehension  

- **Multilingual Capabilities**  
  Can translate any English lecture into **naturally fluent speech** in multiple major languages, preserving tone, flow, and clarity.

- **Slide-Only Mode**  
  Even without a transcript, GatorMate can generate a **complete, coherent class** purely from course slides, automatically constructing explanations, transitions, and examples.
